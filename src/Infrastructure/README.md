# Infrastructure Layer - Template

The Infrastructure layer provides implementations for external concerns like databases, file systems, and external services.

## Purpose

The Infrastructure layer:

- Implements interfaces defined in the Application layer
- Provides concrete implementations for data persistence
- Handles external system communication
- Manages technical concerns that support the application

## Template Status

This template includes a basic structure for the Infrastructure layer along with a sample service implementation. Additional implementations will need to be added according to your specific requirements.

### Included Examples

- **Sample Service**: `HelloWorldService` implementing the `IHelloWorldService` interface
- **Structure**: Organized by technical capability (Services, Persistence, etc.)

### Suggested Structure

## Key Characteristics

- Depends on the Application layer
- Contains implementations of interfaces defined in Domain and Application
- Contains all the IO bound concerns (database, external APIs, file system)
- Manages configuration and setup of third-party libraries
- Is the most volatile layer as technology choices may change

## Required Dependencies

These NuGet packages are expected to be used but might not be installed yet:

- **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore**: For data access
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Logging**: For logging implementations
- **Other Implementation-Specific Packages**: Based on your infrastructure choices

## Typical Contents

- **Persistence**:
  - Database context implementation
  - Repository implementations
  - Migrations
  - Data seeding
  - Data mapping configurations

- **External Services**:
  - API clients
  - Third-party service integrations
  - Email services
  - File storage implementations

- **Security**:
  - Authentication implementations
  - Authorization services
  - Encryption services

- **Caching**:
  - Cache implementations
  - Distributed cache configuration

- **Messaging**:
  - Message queue implementations
  - Event bus implementations
  - Background job processing

## Common Patterns Used

- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access logic
- **Unit of Work**: Manages transactions and maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction
- **Adapter Pattern**: Wraps external libraries/systems to conform to application interfaces
- **Factory Pattern**: Creates complex objects

## Guidelines

- Structure code based on technical capabilities rather than business features
- Keep the implementation details isolated from the rest of the application
- Use dependency injection to register implementations
- Ensure each implementation fully satisfies its corresponding interface contract
- Minimize direct dependencies on specific technologies to allow for future changes
- Write integration tests for infrastructure components
- Keep configuration and environment-specific settings in appropriate config files
